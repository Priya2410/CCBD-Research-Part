commands used:
perf trace -p pid -s
&
perf stat 'syscalls:sys_enter_*' -p pid
(note: both commands are used to trace system calls but the first command is upto 6 times faster giving output thread wise while the second command gives a summarised stat of system calls for all threads running that process)
